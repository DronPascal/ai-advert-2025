# Project Brief - Regoose AI Test Generation Agent

## Project Overview

Regoose is an AI-powered test generation agent that automatically analyzes code, generates comprehensive test suites, executes them in secure containers, and provides detailed reports. Built with a scalable multi-agent architecture inspired by Goose and LangGraph patterns.

## Core Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Automated Test Generation**: Use LLMs to analyze code and generate high-quality, comprehensive tests
2. **Secure Execution**: Run all tests in isolated Podman containers for security
3. **Multi-Language Support**: Support any programming language through LLM analysis
4. **Rich Reporting**: Generate detailed Markdown reports with test results and analysis
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Foundation for multi-agent development workflows

### Key Features
- AI-powered test generation using OpenAI and local LLMs
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for filesystem and shell operations
- Container-based test execution with Podman/Docker
- Interactive CLI with rich user experience
- Multi-Agent System framework for complex workflows
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- ✅ Generate tests for any programming language
- ✅ Execute tests in secure containers  
- ✅ Produce detailed Markdown reports
- ✅ Support multiple LLM providers
- ✅ CLI interface with interactive mode
- ✅ MCP integration for safe operations

### Future Milestones
- Web interface for team collaboration
- CI/CD pipeline integrations
- Advanced test generation strategies
- Performance optimization
- Enterprise features

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.10+**: Main implementation language
- **OpenAI API**: Primary LLM provider
- **Podman/Docker**: Container isolation
- **MCP Protocol**: Tool integration
- **Rich/Typer**: CLI interface

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Provider Pattern**: Pluggable LLM backends
- **Security First**: Container isolation by default
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking execution
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Self-testing agent

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Test generation for any programming language
- Container-based test execution
- Multiple LLM provider support
- MCP tool integration
- CLI interface and interactive mode
- Multi-agent framework foundation
- Documentation and examples

### Out of Scope (Phase 1)
- Web interface
- Database persistence
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced debugging tools
- Performance profiling

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Individual Developers**: Personal coding projects
- **QA Engineers**: Test automation workflows
- **DevOps Teams**: CI/CD integration needs

### Secondary Users
- **Development Teams**: Collaborative testing
- **Educators**: Teaching test-driven development
- **Open Source Projects**: Community contributions

## Business Value

### Immediate Benefits
- **Time Saving**: Automated test generation reduces manual effort
- **Quality Improvement**: AI generates edge cases humans might miss  
- **Security**: Container isolation prevents code execution risks
- **Consistency**: Standardized test patterns and reporting

### Strategic Value
- **Foundation for AI Development Tools**: Extensible multi-agent platform
- **Knowledge Capture**: Session-based learning and improvement
- **Integration Platform**: MCP ecosystem participation
- **Innovation Driver**: Showcase of AI-powered development workflows

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **LLM Quality**: Generated tests may need human review
- **Container Dependencies**: Podman/Docker availability
- **API Costs**: OpenAI usage scaling with adoption

### Mitigation Strategies
- Multiple LLM provider support (local models)
- Fallback execution without containers
- Cost monitoring and usage optimization
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Timeline

### Phase 1: MVP (Completed) ✅
- Core agent implementation
- LLM integration and test generation
- Container execution and reporting
- CLI interface and documentation

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Future)
- Performance optimization
- Advanced test strategies
- Web interface development
