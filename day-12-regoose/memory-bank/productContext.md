# Product Context - Regoose

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Software testing remains one of the most time-consuming and error-prone aspects of development:
- **Manual Test Writing**: Developers spend 30-50% of time writing tests
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Human bias leads to missed edge cases
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Test quality varies greatly between developers
- **Security Risks**: Running untrusted code during test development
- **Knowledge Loss**: Test patterns not shared or documented

### Market Opportunity
- Growing demand for AI-powered development tools
- Increased focus on automated testing and quality assurance
- Rise of containerized development environments
- Adoption of AI coding assistants in professional workflows

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

#### For Individual Developers
1. **Instant Test Generation**: Paste code, get comprehensive tests in seconds
2. **Safe Execution**: Run tests without worrying about system security
3. **Rich Feedback**: Understand what tests cover and why they matter
4. **Learning Tool**: Improve testing skills through AI-generated examples

#### For Teams
1. **Consistent Standards**: Standardized test patterns across projects
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Best practices embedded in generated tests
3. **Quality Gates**: Automated quality checks before code review
4. **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation

### Core Workflows

#### Basic Test Generation
```
Code Input → AI Analysis → Test Generation → Container Execution → Report
```

#### Interactive Development
```
Developer ↔ AI Agent → Iterative Refinement → Enhanced Test Suite
```

#### Multi-Agent Collaboration
```
Analyzer Agent → Generator Agent → Validator Agent → Reporter Agent
```
