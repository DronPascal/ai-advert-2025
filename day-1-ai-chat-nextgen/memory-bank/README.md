## Recent Updates

### 11 August 2025 Major Enhancements

#### Format Context & System UI Improvements (Day 2)
- **System Message Dividers**: Elegant system event separators with icons (üîÑ format, ‚ú® new thread, üóëÔ∏è clear)
- **Format Context Preservation**: Fixed format loss on repeated changes within sessions

### Critical Resolution: Hilt + KSP + Kotlin 2.1+ Compatibility
- **Issue**: JavaPoet ClassName.canonicalName() error preventing Hilt code generation
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete plugin configuration in root build.gradle.kts
- **Solution**: All plugins must be declared in root build file (see ADR-0004)
- **Result**: 100% build success with working dependency injection
