# ADR-0010: Production Code Quality Standards

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-13  
**Context:** Establishing comprehensive code quality standards for production readiness

## Context

After extensive code analysis and optimization, we need to formalize the code quality standards that ensure the project maintains production-grade quality. This includes static analysis compliance, dead code elimination, and architectural consistency.

## Decision

We establish the following code quality standards as mandatory for production releases:

### 1. Static Analysis Compliance
- **Detekt**: Must pass with zero weighted issues (`./gradlew detekt`)
- **Android Lint**: Must pass with zero unused resource/code warnings
- **Custom Analysis**: Regular AST-based analysis for comprehensive coverage

### 2. Dead Code Elimination
- **Zero Tolerance**: No unused classes, functions, or properties in production code
- **Verification Methods**: Multi-tool approach (Lint + Detekt + ProGuard + Custom)
- **Exception Handling**: All "potentially unused" elements must be verified as needed

### 3. Error Handling Patterns
- **Expected Exception Pattern**: Use `catch (expected: Exception)` for explicit intent
- **Specific Exceptions**: Catch specific types when possible (IOException, HttpException)
- **Result Pattern**: Maintain type-safe error handling with Result<T>

### 4. Architectural Suppressions
Strategic use of @Suppress for legitimate architectural patterns:
- `@Suppress("ReturnCount")` for Result pattern methods
- `@Suppress("LongParameterList")` for Compose components requiring many parameters
- `@Suppress("LongMethod")` for inherently complex Compose screens
- `@file:Suppress("MatchingDeclarationName")` for interface-named files

### 5. Configuration Standards
- **Detekt Configuration**: Tailored limits for Android/Compose patterns
- **Build Configuration**: Conflict-free, all plugins properly declared
- **Dependency Management**: Locked versions, compatibility verified

## Implementation

### Build Integration
```bash
# Required checks before merge/release
./gradlew detekt          # Must pass with zero issues
./gradlew test           # All tests must pass
./gradlew assembleRelease # Must build successfully
```

### Monitoring
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular analysis runs in CI/CD
- **Quality Gates**: No merge without passing all quality checks
- **Documentation**: All suppressions must have justifying comments

### Tools Configuration
1. **Detekt**: Configured with Android-specific limits and disabled irrelevant rules
2. **Lint**: Default configuration with unused resource detection
3. **ProGuard/R8**: Enabled for release builds to catch unused code
4. **Custom Analyzer**: AST-based analysis for comprehensive coverage

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Production Confidence**: Zero static analysis warnings ensure high code quality
- **Maintainability**: Clean codebase without dead code or unnecessary complexity
- **Team Standards**: Clear guidelines for code quality expectations
- **Automated Quality**: Build-integrated checks prevent quality regression

### Challenges
- **Initial Setup**: Requires comprehensive configuration and understanding
- **Learning Curve**: Team must understand when suppressions are appropriate
- **Maintenance**: Configuration must be updated as tools evolve

## Verification

Current status after implementation:
- ✅ Detekt: 0 issues (reduced from 140)
- ✅ Lint: 0 unused code warnings
- ✅ Dead Code: 0% (comprehensive verification completed)
- ✅ Build: All variants build successfully
- ✅ Tests: 100% passing with preserved functionality
