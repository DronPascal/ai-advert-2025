## High priority
- [ ] Persist chat history locally (e.g., Room or DataStore) with simple retention policy.
- [ ] Add unit tests for `ChatViewModel` (state updates, error handling, demo mode).
- [ ] Add acceptance test covering basic chat flow in demo mode.

## Medium priority
- [ ] Theme settings (light/dark system follow, toggle in UI).
- [ ] Export conversation (share as text file).
- [ ] Internationalization (EN + RU initial set).

## Low priority
- [ ] Voice input for messages.
- [ ] Model settings (temperature, model name) via safe UI; keep keys in `local.properties` only.

## Notes
- Items originate from the module README’s “Possible improvements” section, adapted to be actionable and secure-by-default.
