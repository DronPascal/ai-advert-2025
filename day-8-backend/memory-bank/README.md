# Memory Bank - Crypto Daily Digest Service

This memory bank contains comprehensive project documentation for the crypto daily digest service that automates market analysis through AI orchestration.

## Structure Overview

### Core Files (Complete âœ…)
- **`projectbrief.md`** - Foundation document defining mission, requirements, and success criteria
- **`productContext.md`** - Product vision, user problems, and market context  
- **`techContext.md`** - Technology stack, dependencies, and technical constraints
- **`systemPatterns.md`** - Architecture patterns, design decisions, and component relationships
- **`activeContext.md`** - Current work focus, recent changes, and immediate next steps
- **`progress.md`** - Detailed status of what's working, what's pending, and known issues

## Project Status Summary

### âœ… **Implementation Complete** 
The crypto daily digest service is **fully implemented** and ready for deployment:
- Complete Python application with OpenAI Responses API integration
- Docker containerization with production and development environments
- APScheduler-based daily execution at 22:00 Europe/Amsterdam
- Comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and logging
- Full documentation and testing infrastructure

### ðŸ”„ **Next Critical Step: MCP Server Setup**
The only remaining blocker is setting up HTTP endpoints for the 3 MCP servers:
1. **web3-research-mcp** - Market data and analysis
2. **crypto-whitepapers-mcp** - PDF analysis and knowledge base  
3. **mcp-communicator-telegram** - Message delivery

All MCP servers currently use stdio transport and need HTTP wrappers for OpenAI cloud access.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Remote MCP Orchestration Pattern
- Single OpenAI Responses API call coordinates all data gathering and delivery
- AI agent makes coordination decisions, not application code
- Minimal infrastructure with maximum intelligence leverage

### Environment-Based Configuration  
- Zero secrets in source code
- Container-native deployment approach
- Audit-friendly security model

### Reliability-First Design
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Response ID caching for cost optimization
- Comprehensive logging and health monitoring

## Usage Instructions

### For New Team Members
1. Start with `projectbrief.md` to understand the mission
2. Read `productContext.md` for business context
3. Review `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` for technical understanding
4. Check `activeContext.md` for current status and immediate priorities
5. Use `progress.md` to understand what's ready vs what needs work

### For Deployment
1. Review current blockers in `activeContext.md`
2. Follow deployment instructions in main `README.md`
3. Use `progress.md` milestone targets for planning

### For Maintenance
- Update `activeContext.md` when changing focus areas
- Update `progress.md` after completing major components
- Maintain `systemPatterns.md` when making architectural changes

## Memory Bank Health: ðŸŸ¢ Complete
All required core files created and populated with comprehensive project context. Ready to support development continuation after memory resets.
