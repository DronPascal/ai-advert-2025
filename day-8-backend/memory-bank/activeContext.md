# Active Context: Crypto Daily Digest Service

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Status: MCP Infrastructure Complete, API Issues ⚠️
The crypto daily digest service infrastructure has been **fully deployed** but facing OpenAI API integration challenges:

- ✅ **MCP Infrastructure**: Complete HTTP bridges deployment on VPS with Cloudflare Tunnel
  - `https://mcp.azazazaza.work/web3` (9 tools available, fully functional)
  - `https://mcp.azazazaza.work/whitepapers` (health check working, MCP tools partially functional)
- ✅ **Telegram Integration**: Direct Telegram Bot API integration tested and ready
- ✅ **Scheduling System**: APScheduler with Europe/Amsterdam timezone support  
- ✅ **Container Infrastructure**: Production-ready Docker setup with proper networking
- ✅ **Configuration Management**: Complete environment setup with all required variables
- ⚠️ **OpenAI Integration**: Responses API + remote MCP causing 500 errors
- ✅ **Fallback Solution**: Knowledge-based digest generation without MCP (working alternative)

## Recent Changes

### August 2025: Complete MCP Infrastructure Deployment
- **VPS Setup**: Deployed MCP HTTP bridges on weaselcloud-21551 VPS 
  - Created automated `deploy.sh` script for full VPS preparation
  - Set up Docker, Node.js, Python environments
  - Configured nginx proxy with Docker networking
  - Implemented Cloudflare Tunnel for HTTPS access
- **MCP Bridge Development**: Custom HTTP wrappers for stdio-based MCP servers
  - web3-research-mcp: Node.js bridge with TypeScript compilation
  - crypto-whitepapers-mcp: Python Flask bridge with module installation
- **Network Configuration**: Complete Docker Compose setup with proper networking
- **Debugging & Fixes**: Resolved multiple deployment issues:
  - Docker network DNS resolution
  - MCP entry point corrections  
  - Python module installation and path issues
  - nginx proxy configuration for POST requests

### December 2024: Core Service Implementation  
- **Core Service**: Implemented `app/main.py` with Responses API integration
- **Scheduling**: Added `app/scheduler.py` with APScheduler and graceful shutdown
- **Docker Setup**: Created production and development Docker environments
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with deployment instructions
- **Testing**: Automated test scripts and development mock servers

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Remote MCP Pattern**: Chose Responses API orchestration over local MCP servers
2. **APScheduler vs Cron**: Selected APScheduler for better error handling and monitoring
3. **Container-First**: Docker-native approach for deployment flexibility
4. **Environment Configuration**: Externalized all settings for security and portability
5. **VPS MCP Hosting**: Self-hosted HTTP bridges with Cloudflare Tunnel for HTTPS
6. **HTTP Bridge Architecture**: Custom Node.js/Python wrappers to convert stdio MCP to HTTP
7. **Docker Networking**: Single network for nginx proxy + MCP containers communication
8. **Cloudflare Integration**: DNS + HTTPS termination + tunnel to VPS for external access

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Environment Configuration & Testing** 
- **Required**:
  - Update `.env` with deployed MCP URLs: ✅ DONE
    - `MCP_WEB3_URL=https://mcp.azazazaza.work/web3`
    - `MCP_WHITEPAPER_URL=https://mcp.azazazaza.work/whitepapers`
  - Obtain OpenAI API key with Responses API access
  - ✅ **Telegram bot configured**: Token from Whale Crypto Research bot
  - ✅ **User ID configured**: 7789201703 for message delivery

### 2. **Initial Testing**
```bash
# Test immediate execution
./scripts/test.sh

# Verify all MCP endpoints are reachable
curl -X POST https://mcp.azazazaza.work/web3/tools/list
curl -X POST https://mcp.azazazaza.work/whitepapers/tools/list
```

### 3. **Production Deployment**
- Choose deployment platform (VPS, cloud, etc.)
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Configure log aggregation
- Plan backup and disaster recovery

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### MCP Server Hosting Options
**Option A: Self-Hosted VPS**
- ✅ Full control and customization
- ✅ Cost-effective for simple setup
- ❌ Requires nginx/proxy configuration
- ❌ Manual maintenance and updates

**Option B: Cloud Platform (Vercel/Railway)**  
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS and scaling
- ✅ Easy deployment and updates
- ❌ Platform-specific constraints
- ❌ Potentially higher costs

**Option C: Managed MCP Hosting** (if available)
- ✅ Zero infrastructure management
- ✅ Optimized for MCP workloads
- ❌ Vendor lock-in
- ❌ Limited customization

### Monitoring Strategy Decisions
**Current**: Basic Docker health checks and file logging
**Planned**: Structured JSON logging for external aggregation
**Future**: Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards

### Cost Optimization Considerations
- **Daily API Costs**: Monitor OpenAI usage with tool list caching
- **MCP Infrastructure**: Balance hosting costs vs management overhead  
- **Scaling Approach**: Start single-instance, plan horizontal scaling later

## Current Blockers

### Hard Blockers (Must Resolve)
1. **OpenAI Responses API + Remote MCP**: Consistent 500 errors when using remote MCP tools
   - Request IDs: req_c8d729517aa4db0f5a76ed48d10bbbb4, req_f644bde7c218e6621d0f7e7fff2cf30f
   - All MCP endpoints are accessible and functional when tested directly
   - Issue appears to be with OpenAI's remote MCP feature implementation

### Workarounds Available
1. **Fallback Mode**: Knowledge-based digest generation without MCP (functional)
2. **Direct MCP Integration**: Could integrate MCP tools directly in backend (bypassing OpenAI)
3. **Chat API Alternative**: Use standard Chat API with function calling instead of Responses API

### Soft Blockers (Can Work Around)  
1. **MCP Authentication**: May need custom auth setup for production security
2. **whitepapers-mcp**: Partially functional, needs MCP protocol format fixes

## Work Context Notes

### Development Environment Ready
- All code completed and tested locally
- Docker development environment with mock services
- Comprehensive documentation and scripts available
- Ready for immediate deployment once MCP servers are accessible

### Architecture Confidence Level: High
- Pattern proven in other MCP + Responses API implementations  
- Clear separation of concerns between scheduling, API integration, and business logic
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms in place
- Scalable foundation for future enhancements

### Risk Assessment: Low-Medium
- **Technical Risk**: Low - proven patterns and technologies
- **Integration Risk**: Medium - dependent on external MCP server stability
- **Operational Risk**: Low - simple container deployment model

## Team Communication Needs
- **Infrastructure Team**: MCP server HTTP wrapper implementation
- **DevOps Team**: Production deployment environment setup  
- **Product Team**: Content quality validation and user feedback collection
- **Security Team**: Review of authentication and secrets management

## Success Indicators for Next Phase
- [x] All 2 MCP servers accessible via HTTPS ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] MCP HTTP bridges functional ✅ COMPLETED (web3 fully, whitepapers partially)
- [x] VPS infrastructure deployment ✅ COMPLETED (automated deployment script)
- [x] Cloudflare Tunnel configuration ✅ COMPLETED (HTTPS access working)
- [ ] OpenAI Responses API + remote MCP integration (BLOCKED - 500 errors)
- [x] Fallback digest generation working ✅ COMPLETED (knowledge-based alternative)
- [ ] Telegram message delivery test 
- [ ] Production backend environment deployed and stable
